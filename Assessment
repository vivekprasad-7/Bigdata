Answer Q1 (Mandatory) and either of Q2 or Q3
Question 1
Design a tv remote control system and Find a minimum number of clicks to reach each given
channel.
Constraints:
i. Total number of channels: 199
ii. It will start from 001 if you cross 199.
iii. Consider parental controls. If there is a "Parental blocked" channel comes while
traversing, it will be skipped and goes to the next channel.
Iv: If you directly press the “parantel blocked” channel, it will skip and go to the next
channel.
v: Have to traverse the channels in the given order.
Options to Traverse in the Remote:
1. You can reach a channel directly by choosing the channel number.
2. You can press forward
3. You can press backward
Example:
Current channel = 45
Input channels = [123, 124]
Number of clicks to reach each channel = 3,1
To reach channel 123, We need 3 clicks on the remote. But to reach from 123 to 124, I just
need one click.
Sample Input:
Current channel = 001
List of channels to traverse = [012, 045, 044, 125, 128, 199, 001]
Parental Blocked = [126, 127, 199]
Sample Output:
3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0
1Question 2
int arr[] = {1,3,2,4,6,2,9,6,8,0};
Write a program to print first duplicate element in given array ?
Question 3
There is an array of length 10K and for a given element you have to print "YES" if present else "NO".
There will be no update to the array but
search request can be very frequent. What can be an efficient process to solve this problem?
